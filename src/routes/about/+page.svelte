      <p class="mb-4">
        Nordics Today is an English-language news platform dedicated to covering the Nordic region. We report on the stories that matter from Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, and Iceland—from breaking political developments to cultural trends shaping Northern Europe.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        The Nordic countries punch above their weight on the global stage. They're home to some of the world's most innovative companies, progressive policies, and unique approaches to everything from climate action to social welfare. Yet much of this news never reaches English-speaking audiences. That's where we come in.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        We're journalists, editors, and Nordic affairs specialists who believe these stories deserve a wider audience. Whether you're an expat living in Scandinavia, a business professional tracking Nordic markets, or simply curious about this fascinating corner of Europe, we're here to keep you informed.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">How We Work</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Good journalism requires both speed and accuracy. Our editorial team monitors developments across all five Nordic countries daily, identifying stories that matter to our English-speaking readership.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        We work with correspondents and partner organizations throughout the region to ensure our coverage is timely, accurate, and provides the context international readers need. Every story is reviewed for accuracy and includes clear source attribution.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Our focus is simple: if it's important news from the Nordics, we cover it. From parliamentary elections in Stockholm to startup funding rounds in Helsinki, from climate policy debates in Copenhagen to volcanic eruptions in Iceland—we're tracking the stories that shape the region.

    <section class="mb-8">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Why the Nordics Matter</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        With a combined population of just 27 million people, the Nordic countries have an outsized influence on global affairs. They consistently top rankings for happiness, innovation, sustainability, and quality of life.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        When Denmark pioneers wind energy solutions, when Sweden debates immigration policy, when Norway manages its sovereign wealth fund, or when Finland revolutionizes education—the world pays attention. These aren't just regional stories. They're laboratories for policies and innovations that other countries study and often adopt.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Nordic companies like Spotify, IKEA, Novo Nordisk, and Ericsson are household names globally. The region's approach to balancing capitalism with social welfare, economic growth with environmental protection, has made it a model others look to—and debate.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        For English speakers trying to understand what's happening in this influential region, reliable news coverage has been hard to find. That's the gap Nordics Today fills.
