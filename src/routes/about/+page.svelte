      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">What this is</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Nordics Today is an English-language news site covering Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, and Iceland. We publish analytical articles, not news rewrites. When something happens in the Nordics, we explain what it means and why it matters to people who live here or do business here.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Most Nordic news is published in Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Finnish, or Icelandic. English-language coverage exists, but it tends to be scattered across country-specific outlets. We put it all in one place and add context that international readers actually need.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Our readers are expats living in Scandinavia, business professionals watching Nordic markets, and people who follow the region for work or personal interest.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">How we work</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Every article starts with verified sources: established Nordic news organizations, government press releases, official statistics, and public records. We research each topic across multiple sources before writing.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        We write analysis, not summaries. If Denmark changes its skilled worker visa rules, we don't just report the change. We explain what the old rules were, what changed, who it affects, and what the numbers look like.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        All articles go through editorial review for accuracy and readability. We cite sources and link to original documents so readers can verify claims themselves.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 italic">
        We use automated research tools and editorial systems to maintain daily coverage across five countries.

    <section class="mb-8">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Why we exist</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        The five Nordic countries have a combined population of 27 million. Their economies are small by global standards, but their policy decisions get studied worldwide. Norway's sovereign wealth fund is the largest on earth. Denmark produces more wind energy per capita than any other country. Finland's education system is a reference point in every school reform debate.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Spotify, IKEA, Novo Nordisk, Ericsson, Nokia, Volvo, Equinor. These are Nordic companies. If you follow global business, you're already following the Nordics whether you realize it or not.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Yet most of this news is published in languages that international readers can't access. The English-language coverage that does exist is spread across dozens of outlets, each covering one country. We consolidate it.
      </p>

    <section class="mb-8">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">What we publish</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        We publish 10 analytical articles per day across all five countries. Each article is researched against multiple sources and written with context that assumes the reader may not know the local background.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        We also publish expat guides, country comparison pieces, and policy explainers. If you're moving to Sweden and need to understand the tax system, or comparing Danish and Norwegian parental leave, those articles exist here too.
