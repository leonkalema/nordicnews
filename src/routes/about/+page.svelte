      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Who We Are</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Nordics Today is an English-language news platform dedicated to covering the Nordic region. The platform delivers stories that matter from Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, and Iceland—from breaking political developments to cultural trends shaping Northern Europe.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        The Nordic countries punch above their weight on the global stage. They're home to some of the world's most innovative companies, progressive policies, and unique approaches to everything from climate action to social welfare. Yet much of this news never reaches English-speaking audiences. Nordics Today exists to bridge that gap.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        The platform serves expats living in Scandinavia, business professionals tracking Nordic markets, researchers, and anyone seeking reliable English-language coverage of this influential region.

    <section class="mb-8">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Why the Nordics Matter</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        With a combined population of just 27 million people, the Nordic countries have an outsized influence on global affairs. They consistently top rankings for happiness, innovation, sustainability, and quality of life.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        When Denmark pioneers wind energy solutions, when Sweden debates immigration policy, when Norway manages its sovereign wealth fund, or when Finland revolutionizes education—the world pays attention. These aren't just regional stories. They're laboratories for policies and innovations that other countries study and often adopt.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Nordic companies like Spotify, IKEA, Novo Nordisk, and Ericsson are household names globally. The region's approach to balancing capitalism with social welfare, economic growth with environmental protection, has made it a model others look to—and debate.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        For English speakers trying to understand what's happening in this influential region, accessible news coverage has historically been limited. Nordics Today addresses this gap.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        <strong>The focus extends beyond reporting events to explaining their significance.</strong> Whether for expats navigating Nordic systems, business professionals tracking regional markets, or researchers studying Nordic policy, the platform provides context essential for understanding the region.
